### CNC parts
To get a perfect fit for the arcade buttons and joysticks, the screen, the power button and the speakers, the 
_button panel_ and the _screen panel_ were CNC-cut. This was more expensive than doing it by hand, but lead to a much 
better finish. To make the cabinet fit perfectly together, the two side panels were also CNC cut, as they have multiple 
rounded shapes that need to be identical on both sides.

Oh, and remember to CNC-cut the CAD file on size 1:1 and not "utilize full MDF board"... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Hand-cut parts
As the rest of the parts were more or less rectangular, they were cut by "hand". To do this, two different mounted saws
were used:
* A vertical panel saw to cut down the MDF to smaller pieces
* A table saw to cut out the final pieces

The only panel that needed some more work was the hatch panel. The outlines of the hatch were first sketched on the 
panel.

![hatch 1](./images/build/hatch_1.jpg)

A circle saw was then used to cut out the actual hatch.

![hatch 2](./images/build/hatch_2.jpg)

![hatch 3](./images/build/hatch_3.jpg)

A hand held jigsaw was used for the edges as it's difficult to know how far the circle saw will cut.

![hatch 4](./images/build/hatch_4.jpg)

After the main part was separated into the inner and outer part, "blockers" were glued and nailed into place. This, 
together with a standard window magnet was used to keep the hatch in place.

A hole was also cut at the top of the inner part to enable it to be opened.

A hole was also drilled at the bottom of the large back panel to prepare for a power strip to be inserted.

### Draw outlines of parts
It was important to fixate all the parts at the same location on both side panels for the cabinet to be symmetrical. To 
simplify this, outlines were drawn where each panel was supposed to be attached to the side panels. As the button panel 
and the screen panel were attached at an angle, their outlines were first drawn on one of the side panels. Then the 
outlines were reflected and transferred to the other side panel by using some reference points. It was a bit tricky, 
so take your time.

### Cut wood biscuits holes
To hold all the panels together, wood biscuits, wood glue and a nail gun were used. The wood biscuits are not only good 
for making the cabinet robust, but they also help with fixating all the panels at the right places and angles. The only 
panel that wasn't attached with wood biscuits was the screen panel. The reason was for the screen to be interchangeable 
if it breaks, something that is not possible (or atleast very difficult) if the panel is glued in place.

When using the wood biscuit cutter, it's important that the holes end up at the correct place at the aligning panels. 
One simple way of solving this is to align your panels and then draw a line on both panels at the center of where you 
want the biscuit to be. If you do this, the holes will end up at the right place.

Before gluing all the parts together, make sure that they fit by placing each panel at their place. A tip is to draw
shapes (triangles, circles etc) on connecting parts, so you easily know which parts that go together later on.

### Glue main parts together
When gluing the parts together, you'll need to be fairly quick and structured. I started of by laying down one side 
panel first, then gluing the middle parts and finally gluing the other side panel.

Start of by adding the glue in the wood biscuit holes. Then press down the wood biscuits into the holes. After that you 
apply wood glue along all the connecting parts and press them together.

![glue 4](./images/build/glue_4.jpg)

![glue 5](./images/build/glue_5.jpg)

![glue 1](./images/build/glue_1.jpg)

When done, make sure that all the parts are aligned and in the right position. Then apply force using large clamps and 
nail everything together using a nail gun.

![glue 6](./images/build/glue_6.jpg)

![glue 7](./images/build/glue_7.jpg)

![glue 8](./images/build/glue_8.jpg)

Also, don't forget to remove redundant glue dripping out from the connecting parts, it makes it much easier to get a 
nice finish later on.

### Adding cabinet legs
To distribute the upwards force from the legs, a small block of wood was glued and nailed in each corner inside the 
cabinet.

![legs 5](./images/build/legs_5.jpg)

I had some wood laying around that I used as legs for the cabinet. After cutting out four squares, make sure that they 
fit nicely in each corner.

![legs 1](./images/build/legs_1.jpg)

Use a sand paper to round the edges.

![legs 2](./images/build/legs_2.jpg)

The legs was then glued from the outside and screwed from the inside.

![legs 3](./images/build/legs_3.jpg)

![legs 4](./images/build/legs_4.jpg)

### Add screen panel
To be able to easily remove and change the screen, the screen panel was screwed in place. Two slim wood bars were
glued and nailed on each inner side at the correct angle for the screen panel to rest on.

![screen panel 1](./images/build/screen_panel_1.jpg)

![screen panel 4](./images/build/screen_panel_4.jpg)

![screen panel 3](./images/build/screen_panel_3.jpg)

To get a nice seamless look of the screen, a handheld milling machine was used to extract a slot for the screen on the
back side of the screen panel.

![screen panel 5](./images/build/screen_panel_5.jpg)

![screen panel 6](./images/build/screen_panel_6.jpg)

![screen panel 7](./images/build/screen_panel_7.jpg)

![screen panel 8](./images/build/screen_panel_8.jpg)

![screen panel 9](./images/build/screen_panel_9.jpg)

The screen I used had button on the front, so I needed to drill holes in the screen panel for them to be clickable.

![screen panel 10](./images/build/screen_panel_10.jpg)

![screen panel 11](./images/build/screen_panel_11.jpg)

![screen panel 12](./images/build/screen_panel_12.jpg)

![screen panel 13](./images/build/screen_panel_13.jpg)

Finally, the screw keeping the screen panel in place were aligned with the speakers to get a nice look.

![screen panel 14](./images/build/screen_panel_14.jpg)

### Preparing the light box
As a true retro arcade cabinet, of course we need a glowing light box at the top of the cabinet. To keep the plexiglass
in place, four small wood cubes were glued and nailed at each corner for the plexiglass to rest on.

![preparing lightbox 1](./images/build/preparing_lightbox_1.jpg)

![preparing lightbox 2](./images/build/preparing_lightbox_2.jpg)

### Spackling paste and sanding
Before the cabinet was sent to spray painting, final touches were made to get a nice smooth finish. Spackling paste 
was applied to cover up all the nails and plastic padding was used to cover up small visible mistakes made. When 
everything had dried, an electric sander was used to remove redundant spackling paste and plastic padding. All the edges
was smoothed by manual sanding.
